<!-- ## Bio -->

Dr. Patricia Musolino is a critical care and vascular neurologist with expertise in white matter disorders and cerebrovascular biology.

She is assistant professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and the co-director of the pediatric stroke and cerebrovascular service at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Dr. Musolino clinical and research expertise revolves around the translation of discoveries in human genetics to clinical application in white matter and cerebrovascular disorders.

Following training in neurosciences, imaging and molecular biology acquired during her PhD in her native Argentina and post-doctoral training at Harvard,
Dr. Musolino completed dual training in pediatric and adult critical care and vascular neurology at MGH.

Dr. Musolino’s laboratory work focuses on leveraging insights from neuroimaging in patients and in-vitro gene-editing tools
to understand how single genes mutations alter blood brain barrier and cerebrovascular function in order to find better therapies
and improve the quality of life of patients with rare genetic disorders. This novel approach has led to multiple high impact publications
and the development of pre-clinical drug screening platforms to develop gene targeted therapies for single gene disorders causing neuroinflammation and stroke at a young age
such as: ALD, ACTA2, HHT, CADASIL, COL4A1 and others.

Working hand in hand with patients and advocacy groups, Dr. Musolino is also developing a network and resources to maximize the life potential of children and young adults affected by these devastating disorders.

Dr. Musolino’s is the recipient of several awards from NINDS, the Hearst and Shields Research Awards and the 2017 Herbert Pardes Clinical Research Excellence Award from the National Clinical Research Forum.

<!-- Dr. Musolino is a clinician-scientist devoted to caring for patients of all ages with devastating brain injury such as stroke and demyelination. Her research revolves around the translation of discoveries in human genetics to clinical application in cerebrovascular disorders. Through treating patients in the critical care and stroke units at MGH, she has gained an understanding of the unmet needs in these devastating disorders. Dr. Musolino’s laboratory focuses on leveraging brain imaging, animal models and gene-editing tools to understand how single genes mutations alter brain vessels in order to find better therapies and improve the quality of life of patients suffering monogenic vascular disorders. -->
